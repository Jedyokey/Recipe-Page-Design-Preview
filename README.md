## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm grateful for this kind of project. I had an issue with the border-bottom below "Ingredients and Instructions" sections. I can't centralize the border-bottom below each of those sections in mobile and tab screen. It ends up spanning the entire width on both screens. I'm yet to find a solution to fix that issue. This is one creative poject I love so much. Kudos to the team!
